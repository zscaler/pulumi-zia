// * [Official documentation](https://help.zscaler.com/zia/about-ssl-inspection-policy)
// * [API documentation](https://help.zscaler.com/zia/ssl-inspection-policy#/sslInspectionRules-get)
//
// The **zia_ssl_inspection_rules** resource allows the creation and management of SSL Inspection rules in the Zscaler Internet Access.
//
// **NOTE 1** Zscaler SSL Inspection rules contain default and predefined rules which cannot be deleted. The provider **automatically handles predefined rules** during rule ordering. You can simply use sequential order values (1, 2, 3...) and the provider will:
// - Automatically place new rules at the correct position
// - Handle reordering around predefined rules
// - Avoid configuration drift
//
// Example: If there are 2 predefined rules in your tenant, you can still configure your rules starting at `order = 1`. The provider will automatically handle the reordering to place your rules in the correct position relative to predefined rules.
//
// **NOTE 2** Certain attributes on `predefined` rules can still be managed or updated via Terraform such as:
//
// * `description` - (Optional) Enter additional notes or information. The description cannot exceed 10,240 characters.
// * `state` - (Optional) An enabled rule is actively enforced. A disabled rule is not actively enforced but does not lose its place in the Rule Order. The service skips it and moves to
// * `labels` (list) - Labels that are applicable to the rule.
//   - `id` - (Integer) Identifier that uniquely identifies an entity
//
// **NOTE 3** The import of `predefined` rules is still possible in case you want o have them under the Terraform management; however, remember that these rules cannot be deleted. That means, the provider will fail when executing `terraform destroy`; hence, you must remove the rules you want to delete, and re-run `pulumi up` instead.
