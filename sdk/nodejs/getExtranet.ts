 *
 * Use the **zia_extranet** data source to get information about extranets configured for the organization in the Zscaler Internet Access cloud. Extranets are configured as part of Zscaler Extranet Application Support which allows an organization to connect its internal network with another organization’s network (e.g., partners, third-party vendors, etc.) that does not use the Zscaler service. Extranet Application Support enables Zscaler-managed organization users to securely access extranet resources through an IPSec VPN tunnel established between the Zscaler data center and the external organization’s data center, without requiring additional hardware or software installations.

 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Retrieve By Name
 *
 * ### Retrieve By ID
