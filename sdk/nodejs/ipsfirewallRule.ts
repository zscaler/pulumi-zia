 * * [API documentation](https://help.zscaler.com/zia/configuring-ips-control-policy)
 *
 * The **zia_firewall_ips_rule** resource allows the creation and management of ZIA Cloud Firewall IPS rules in the Zscaler Internet Access.
 *
 * **NOTE 1** Zscaler Cloud Firewall contain default and predefined rules which cannot be deleted (not all attributes are supported on predefined rules). The provider **automatically handles predefined rules** during rule ordering. You can simply use sequential order values (1, 2, 3...) and the provider will:
 *
 * * Automatically place new rules at the correct position
 * * Handle reordering around predefined rules
 * * Avoid configuration drift
 *
 * Example: If there are predefined rules in your tenant, you can still configure your rules starting at `order = 1`. The provider will automatically handle the reordering to place your rules in the correct position relative to predefined rules.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
